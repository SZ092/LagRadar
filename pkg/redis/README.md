# Redis Integration - TBD

This directory will contain Redis integration modules for LagRadar.

---

## Potential Use Cases

### 1. Advanced Analytics & Caching

- Store historical consumer lag or offset data for scenarios that require more detailed or longer-term analysis than what Prometheus provides.
- Serve as a high-speed cache for repeated or computationally expensive Kafka queries.

### 2. Distributed Coordination

- Enable distributed LagRadar deployments to share sliding window state, coordinate leader election, or deduplicate cross-instance tasks.

### 3. **Automated Root Cause Analysis (RCA) â€“ Future Module**

#### Why Redis?
- Redis will serve as the backbone for asynchronous task queues, event deduplication, and rapid, short-term state persistence needed by automated RCA pipelines.
- Unlike Prometheus, which is optimized for time series metrics, Redis supports advanced workflows such as:
    - Event streaming (using Redis Streams or Lists) to queue and distribute RCA tasks.
    - Distributed locking and frequency-limiting to avoid duplicate RCA analysis or alert storms.
    - Temporary session storage for in-progress RCA jobs, allowing for multi-step diagnostic workflows across multiple service components.
- Example RCA pipeline with Redis:
    1. LagRadar detects a consumer lag anomaly and pushes an event into a Redis queue.
    2. One or more RCA workers consume events from Redis, perform multi-stage root cause inference, and write results or suggested remediations back to Redis (with TTL).
    3. Downstream alerting or visualization modules read final RCA results from Redis, enabling fast, decoupled integrations.
