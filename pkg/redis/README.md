# Redis Integration - TBD

This directory documents experimental and planned Redis integration modules for LagRadar.

---

## Potential Use Cases (for personal research/demo)

- **Advanced Analytics & Caching:**  
  Store historical lag/offset data for advanced analytics not covered by Prometheus; high-speed cache for expensive queries.

- **Distributed Coordination:**  
  Share sliding window state, enable leader election, deduplicate tasks in distributed LagRadar deployments.

- **Automated Root Cause Analysis (RCA):**  
  Redis as backbone for asynchronous task queues, deduplication, and fast state for future RCA automation modules.

> **Note:**  
> Redis is not required for basic LagRadar monitoring.  
> This directory exists for personal research, architectural prototyping, and demonstration purposes onlyâ€”not for community contribution or production use.
