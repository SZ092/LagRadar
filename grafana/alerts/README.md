# Grafana Alerts (Planned)

This directory is reserved for Grafana alert rules, notification templates, and example alerting configurations for LagRadar.

**Planned use cases:**
- Version-controlled alert rule JSON or YAML for common SRE scenarios (e.g., high consumer lag, stalled partitions).
- Notification channel templates for Slack, Email, PagerDuty, etc.
- Example setups for integrating LagRadar metrics with Grafana alerting.

> Alerting logic is not required for LagRadar to operate, but recommended for production SRE workflows.
