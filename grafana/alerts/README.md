# Grafana Alerts (Planned)

This directory is reserved for future experiments and example configurations related to Grafana alert rules, notification templates, and alerting setups for LagRadar.

> Note:  
> These alerting examples are provided for technical demonstration only.  
> Grafana integration and alert rule templates are not actively maintained or supported as production-ready features.

**Planned internal use cases (for reference):**
- Version-controlled alert rule JSON or YAML for common SRE scenarios (e.g., high consumer lag, stalled partitions)
- Notification channel templates (Slack, Email, PagerDuty, etc.)
- Example integration setups with LagRadar metrics and Grafana alerting

**Alerting logic is not required for LagRadar to operate, and this directory is for personal reference—not for community contribution or production use.**
