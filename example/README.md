# LagRadar Example Dashboards

This directory documents sample Grafana dashboards and visualizations built with LagRadar metrics.

## Note

The dashboards and screenshots in `legacy/` reflect previous versions of LagRadar and are **not fully compatible** with current or upcoming releases.

> LagRadar is a personal engineering project for technical demonstration and is not maintained as a community or production OSS.  
> Dashboards here are provided as references for local demo and historical comparison only.

## Current Status

- The main collector engine is being refactored. For details, see the [Roadmap](../README.md#roadmap).
- Example dashboards for the new architecture will be added once core features are stable.
- Community contributions and pull requests are **not accepted** at this time.
