# LagRadar Example Dashboards

This directory documents example Grafana dashboards and visualizations built with LagRadar metrics.


## Note

The dashboards and screenshots in `legacy/` reflect previous versions of LagRadar and are **not fully compatible** with current or upcoming releases.

> LagRadar is under active development. Core features like **multi-cluster monitoring** and **multi-consumer-group support** are being redesigned. The dashboards here are kept as references for legacy use cases and for historical comparison.


## Current Status

- The main collector engine is being refactored. For more details about the priorities, please refer to  [Roadmap](../README.md#roadmap)
- Example dashboards for the new architecture will be added once core features are stable.
- **Contributions** of updated dashboards or Grafana configs for the new API are very welcome!

## Contributing

- If you have dashboards or visualization setups for recent LagRadar versions, please open a PR to `examples/` or start a discussion.
- For legacy setups, see `legacy/` for panel layouts and example queries.
